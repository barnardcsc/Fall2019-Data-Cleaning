# Data Cleaning, Fall 2019
An introductory workshop on data cleaning using Python, Pandas, and a public MTA turnstile dataset. Part of a two-part series on Python's Pandas library.

Follow along the workshop by making a copy of "Data-Cleaning-Student.ipynb," opening it as a Jupyter notebook, and writing directly in the code cells. Open the "Data-Cleaning-Key.ipynb" file to reference the completed code cells.
